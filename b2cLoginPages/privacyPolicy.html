            Kaam Care does not sell or share information that, on its own, identifies you, like your name or email address. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, if consent is given by you, we do share other identifiers with partners for product, service and advertising reasons. Sharing this information allows us to provide the content and services you enjoy, helps our partners deliver better content and advertising, and keeps our services supported by our advertisers. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act some of this sharing may be considered a "sale" that you have a right to opt out of.
            You have the right to direct Kaam Care not to sell or share your personal information. You may direct Kaam Care not to sell or share your personal information by turning off the "allow the 'sale' or 'sharing' of my Personal Information" control in your Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.
            If you choose to opt out of selling or sharing, such action may impact how you are able to view and/or receive some services that Kaam Care offers. This is because some of the services that Kaam Care offers require disclosure of your personal information to third parties, and such disclosure may be deemed selling or sharing under the CCPA.
            Kaam Care sells or shares different categories of personal information to third parties depending on the product or service. You may locate the specific categories of personal information sold or shared in the last 12 months for each product or service you use by logging into your Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.

        <h2 class="common-text sub-title">7. Collection, Use, and Linking of Technical Identifiers</h2>
        <p class="common-text">Kaam Care uses different technical identifiers to make its consumer services available on most platforms, browsers, and devices. Kaam Care also uses these technical identifiers to provide our digital services on our properties and for our business partners.
            <br />These technical identifiers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="common-text">Browser cookie identifiers (sometimes referred to as “cookie IDs”) and browser local storage identifiers</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Mobile device identifiers, such as the Android advertising ID or the Apple Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Platform or operating system-based identifiers, such as those offered on smart or connected TVs or media streaming devices</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Partner-supplied technical identifiers</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Encrypted or one-way cryptographic hashes of personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, account identifiers, derivatives, or escalated versions of these identifiers</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Household-based identifiers</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">IP addresses</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">Probabilistic (non-unique) identifiers</p></li>

        </ul>

        <p class="common-text">
            The storage, generation, and collection methods of these identifiers may also vary, depending on the context. For instance, some browsers and devices offer limited technical identifier support and/or limited cookie support, so non-cookie-based identifiers may be used in these cases. Examples of these devices include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p class="common-text">Certain apps, mobile devices, or installed software, where permitted and applicable</p></li>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p class="common-text">Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information.</p></li>
            <li><p class="common-text">In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children.</p></li>
