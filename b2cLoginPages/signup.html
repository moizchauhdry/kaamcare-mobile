                        Kaam Care does not sell or share information that, on its own, identifies you, like your name or email address. As outlined in our Privacy Policy, if consent is given by you, we do share other identifiers with partners for product, service and advertising reasons. Sharing this information allows us to provide the content and services you enjoy, helps our partners deliver better content and advertising, and keeps our services supported by our advertisers. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act some of this sharing may be considered a "sale" that you have a right to opt out of.
                        You have the right to direct Kaam Care not to sell or share your personal information. You may direct Kaam Care not to sell or share your personal information by turning off the "allow the 'sale' or 'sharing' of my Personal Information" control in your Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.
                        If you choose to opt out of selling or sharing, such action may impact how you are able to view and/or receive some services that Kaam Care offers. This is because some of the services that Kaam Care offers require disclosure of your personal information to third parties, and such disclosure may be deemed selling or sharing under the CCPA.
                        Kaam Care sells or shares different categories of personal information to third parties depending on the product or service. You may locate the specific categories of personal information sold or shared in the last 12 months for each product or service you use by logging into your Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.

Sharing this data allows us to provide the content and services you enjoy, helps our partners deliver better content and advertising, and keeps our services supported by our advertisers.

                        You have the right to direct Kaam Care not to sell your personal data and not to use your personal data for targeted advertising.

                        If you choose to opt out of the sale of your personal data, such action may impact how you are able to view and/or receive some services that Kaam Care offers. This is because some of the services that Kaam Care offers require disclosure of your personal data to third parties, and such disclosure may be deemed selling under the CTPA. Kaam Care sells or shares different categories of personal data to third parties depending on the product or service. You may locate the specific categories of personal data sold or shared in the last 12 months for each product or service you use by logging into your Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard

                        If you choose to opt out of selling, Kaam Care may continue to sell your personal data under the following limited exceptions: the sale is reasonably necessary to enable a third party to provide a benefit to which you are entitled; the sale of personal data to third parties is clearly disclosed in the terms of the program; and the third party uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating such a benefit to which you are entitled and does not retain or otherwise use or disclose the personal data for any other purpose.

As outlined in our Privacy Policy, we do share other identifiers with partners for product, service and targeted advertising reasons. Sharing this data allows us to provide the content and services you enjoy, helps our partners deliver better content and advertising, and keeps our services supported by our advertisers.
                        <br />You have the right to direct Kaam Care not to sell your personal data and to not use your personal data for targeted advertising. You may direct Kaam Care to opt you out of selling your personal data and using your personal data for targeted advertising above or via the sale of personal data and targeted advertising control in the Privacy Dashboard.
                        If you choose to opt out of the sale of your personal data, such action may impact how you are able to view and/or receive some services that Kaam Care offers. This is because some of the services that Kaam Care offers require disclosure of your personal data to third parties and such disclosure may be deemed selling under the VCDPA.
                        Kaam Care sells or shares different categories of personal information to third parties depending on the product or service. You may locate the specific categories of personal data sold or shared in the last 12 months for each product or service you use by logging into the Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.
                        Kaam Care does not process personal data for the purposes of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
                        Across all of our products and services, Kaam Care sells or shares the following categories of personal data to third parties: identifiers (e.g., technical, financial, government identifiers); contact information; physical characteristics or description information; internet or electronic network activity information; geolocation information; commercial information; audio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar information; inferences, including advertising and content related inferences; professional or employment related information.

                        <br/>Use of Precise Geolocation Information in Virginia
                        <br/>The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act requires consumer consent for the collection of precise location data for certain commercial uses. Kaam Care honors this legal requirement by truncating latitude and longitude coordinate information from geolocation data that falls within the state of Virginia. This converts the data into imprecise location data. Virginia residents do not need to manage or effectuate their Precise Location Information opt-out in Kaam Care's Privacy Dashboard to receive this privacy protection.
                        <br/>Verification Process for Access and Deletion
                        <br/>You may access and/or delete your personal data by logging into the Kaam Care Privacy Dashboard.

                    <p class="common-text">Kaam Care uses different technical identifiers to make its consumer services available on most platforms, browsers, and devices. Kaam Care also uses these technical identifiers to provide our digital services on our properties and for our business partners.
                        <br />These technical identifiers include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Browser cookie identifiers (sometimes referred to as “cookie IDs”) and browser local storage identifiers</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Mobile device identifiers, such as the Android advertising ID or the Apple Identifier for Advertising (IDFA)</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Platform or operating system-based identifiers, such as those offered on smart or connected TVs or media streaming devices</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Partner-supplied technical identifiers</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Encrypted or one-way cryptographic hashes of personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, account identifiers, derivatives, or escalated versions of these identifiers</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Household-based identifiers</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">IP addresses</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Probabilistic (non-unique) identifiers</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Identifiers generated from the combination of various device, browser, or operating system attributes, such as the operating system or browser version</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">“Cohort”, audience, or group identifiers, such as “sports enthusiasts”</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="common-text">
                        The storage, generation, and collection methods of these identifiers may also vary, depending on the context. For instance, some browsers and devices offer limited technical identifier support and/or limited cookie support, so non-cookie-based identifiers may be used in these cases. Examples of these devices include:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Certain apps, mobile devices, or installed software, where permitted and applicable</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Certain internet-of-things (IoT) devices</p></li>
                        <li><p class="common-text">Browsers enabled with intelligent tracking prevention (ITP), privacy sandbox, or similar cookie-blocking technology</p></li>
